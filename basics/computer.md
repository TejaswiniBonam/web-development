# basic functions of computer
* input
* process
* output
* storage

## Input
* A computer cannot perform a function until it receives input.
* Web developers build interfaces for users to provide input through keyboards, computer mouses, or even touchscreens and microphones or even sensors.
* The computer must translate the data it receives from the input devices into binary code for the computer to either store or process. 

* **Binary code - Machine code -  0’s or 1’s (or false/true or off/on)**

## Processing
* Processing is the series of actions that a computer takes when it receives data. The programs that web developers write will tell the computer what to do with the data that it receives. The computer mainly performs logical operations because the data is converted into 0’s and 1’s.  

## output
* Output is the result of the computer transforming input data, through processing, into usable information. might be letters, numbers, photos, videos, or audio. 
* output devices must do some translation. They decode machine code from the computer into a format that users can understand. 

## Storage
* Web developers need to be aware of, and need to know how to use, short-term storage and long-term storage.  
* **Short-term storage**, also called volatile memory, stores data while the device is running. Websites store data that web pages will use while the user is interacting with it. The data is stored in short-term memory, called random access memory (RAM). For example, suppose you’re developing a site that handles inventory for a shipping firm. When a customer enters an order, the web page will hold the data in short-term memory until the customer clicks or taps a button to submit the order. In many cases, the web browser will handle storing data in short-term memory. 
* **Long-term storage** will retain information even after the device is **powered down**. Devices like **solid-state drives (SDD) or hard disk drives (HDD)** are used for long-term storage. Websites create small files that store information called **cookies**. 
        * A **cookie** stores user-specific data such as the last time that the user visited the site, how long before they need to log in again, and other data. The device’s long term storage stores cookies, which persist between site sessions. A session is the time a user is on a website in one continuous block of time.

# software N Hardware components
* a computer needs both software and harware
* **RAM is a SOFTWARE, like a storage chip**
* The primary software that your computer needs is an **operating system (OS)**. The operating system is like a manager. It enables you to communicate with the computer without knowing machine code. It also manages all software and hardware, and acts as a coordinator between the hardware and all systems that are running. Some examples of operating systems are Linux, Windows, Android, Apple macOS, and Apple iOS.  
* Other software applications, also called programs, are sets of instructions that the computer uses to perform tasks that are beyond the main functions of the operating system. Examples of software applications include web browsers, word processors, and image editors.  

## What is Software?
* **Software** is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. Unlike hardware, which refers to the physical components of a computer, software is intangible and tells the hardware what to do.
* Software can be categorized into two main types:
    * **System software**: This includes operating systems and utilities that manage computer resources.
    * **Application software**: These are programs designed for end users, such as web browsers, games, and productivity tools.


    ## What is Hardware?
    * **Hardware** refers to the physical components of a computer system that you can see and touch. This includes devices such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage drives (HDD, SSD), motherboard, keyboard, mouse, monitor, and other peripherals.
    * Hardware works together with software to perform computing tasks. While hardware provides the necessary infrastructure, software gives instructions for the hardware to execute.
    * Examples of hardware components:
        * **Input devices**: keyboard, mouse, microphone, scanner
        * **Output devices**: monitor, printer, speakers
        * **Storage devices**: hard disk drive (HDD), solid-state drive (SSD), USB flash drive
        * **Processing unit**: central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU)
